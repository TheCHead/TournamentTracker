# TournamentTracker
Windows forms application for making tournaments.
You can register teams with teammembers and assign prizes for winners. All the teams are notified about tournament progression by email.

The purpose of the app was to study principles of SW architecture and data design, working with databases (SQL and text one) and wiring it all to UI application.
